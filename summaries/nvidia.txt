Nvidia is reportedly planning to launch its new Blackwell lineup of gaming GPUs with the GeForce RTX 5080 before the RTX 5090, contradicting earlier reports. This strategy shift comes after Nvidia launched the RTX 4090 in 2022, which became the best graphics card ever. The leak, however, hasn't been confirmed by Nvidia. The RTX 5080 is expected to be faster at ray tracing than the RTX 4090 and will use GDDR7 memory. Details about the specs are still unknown.
