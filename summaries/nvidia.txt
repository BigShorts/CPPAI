Nvidia is reportedly planning to launch its new Blackwell lineup of gaming GPUs with the GeForce RTX 5080 this year, according to tech leaker kopite7kimi. This contradicts earlier reports that the RTX 5090 would be the only Blackwell gaming graphics card to launch this year. Nvidia previously released the RTX 3080 before the RTX 3090 and the RTX 2080 came out before the 2080 Ti. The RTX 5080 is expected to be quicker at ray tracing than the RTX 4090 and will use GDDR7 memory.
