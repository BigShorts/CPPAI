Nvidia is reportedly planning to launch its new Blackwell lineup of gaming GPUs with the GeForce RTX 5080 before the RTX 5090, contradicting earlier reports. This strategy shift comes after Nvidia launched the RTX 4090 in 2022, which became the best graphics card ever. The information is based on a leak from tech leaker kopite7kimi, but Nvidia has not confirmed it. The RTX 5080 is expected to be faster at ray tracing than the RTX 4090 and will use GDDR7 memory. Meanwhile, for those seeking a powerful 4K gaming GPU, the RTX 4080 Super review is recommended.

Note: The information is based on a single leaker's report and has not been confirmed by Nvidia.
