Nvidia plans to launch its new Blackwell gaming GPUs, starting with the GeForce RTX 5080 rather than the RTX 5090, as reported by a leaker. However, information is not confirmed by Nvidia and the company's chief executive. The release date for RTX 5080 and 5090 is still unknown. Nvidia has reportedly followed a strategy of launching less powerful GPUs first in the past, but the company launched high-powered GPU RTX 4090 in 2022, which has been in demand since.
