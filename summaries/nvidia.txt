Nvidia is reportedly planning to launch its new Blackwell lineup with the GeForce RTX 5080 later this year, contradicting earlier reports of starting with the RTX 5090, according to tech leaker kopite7kimi. Nvidia previously launched the RTX 3080 before the RTX 3090, and the RTX 2080 before the 2080 Ti, but launched the GeForce RTX 4090 in 2022 as its flagship GPU. Little is known about the RTX 5080's specifications, but it is expected to be quicker at ray tracing than the RTX 4090 and use GDDR7 memory.
