ASUS accidentally published a listing for the VivoBook S 16 OLED (M5606) with an unknown AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 170 processor, which appears to be an upcoming Zen 5-based mobile chip codenamed Strix Point. The listing, now deleted, suggests the processor has a focus on AI with up to 77 TOPS of AI performance, aligning with Microsoft's definition of an 'AI PC'. This leak, first spotted on Twitter, coincides with AMD's plans to announce Zen 5 and Strix Point at Computex 2024, although no official confirmation has been made. The HX series naming is similar to previous high-end laptop processors from AMD and Intel.
