ASUS accidentally published a spec list for a VivoBook S 16 OLED (M5606) featuring an unknown AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 170 processor, which appears to be an upcoming Zen 5-based mobile chip codenamed Strix Point. The listing, now deleted but still accessible via Google's cache, suggests the processor is an AI-focused variant with a potential NPU integrated, meeting Microsoft's AI PC performance criteria. This leak, first spotted on Twitter, coincides with AMD's plans to announce Zen 5 at Computex 2024, though specifics remain undisclosed.
