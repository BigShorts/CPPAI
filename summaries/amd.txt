ASUS reportedly published a list of specifications for one of its laptops listing an unknown AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 170 processor, likely a Zen 5-based mobile chip codenamed Strix Point. The processor seems to be part of a new naming scheme focused on AI, featuring a Ryzen AI NPU with up to 77 TOPS of AI performance. AMD plans to release the Strix Point lineup in 2024, and the ASUS VivoBook S 16 OLED (M5606) is expected to have updated specifications once the AMD Zen 5 details are released.
