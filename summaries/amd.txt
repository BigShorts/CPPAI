ASUS accidentally listed specifications for an unidentified AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 170 processor on one of its product pages, possibly hinting at an upcoming Zen 5-based mobile chip codenamed Strix Point. The processor appears to be a 12C/24T Zen 5 mobile variant with an integrated Ryzen AI NPU, boasting up to 77 TOPS AI performance. AMD is expected to release the Strix Point lineup in 2024, and the company's CEO, Dr. Lisa Su, has confirmed the enhanced RDNA graphics within the SoC. The official details of Zen 5's performance and architectural shifts over Zen 4 may be revealed at Computex 2024 in the next month.
